        <p>From the first moment I sat in front of a computer at 13 years old my future was clear. At 16 years old I was beginning
          my journey as a software programmer. I was creating games using Visual Basic, I used my creativity to invent and
          explorenew ways of developing computer algorithms. Through my own inquisition I began learning advanced programming
          outside of school, and at 17 I found myself advancing beyond my teachers, and became a self-employed computer programmer.
          I spent the next few years continuing to develop my skills, teaching other students, and working in a technology
          shop in Ahwaz, Iran. </p>
        
        <p>At Azad University I studied Computer Science and Software Engineering Technology. I was exploring and learning the
          subjects on the curriculum before it was taught. I excelled in topics such as: Programming, Database Structure,
          and Analyst and Design Systems, getting the highest marks possible. Modules like System Programming and Artificial
          Intelligence in my later years at University opened new doors for me to explore advanced technology and further
          enjoy my continuing development. Whilst studying I continued my professional development as a self-employed Computer
          Programmer. One of my favourite and most enjoyable projects to this point was the development of an Android Application
          for a cultural project in my city. The App’ consisted of a library of poems from a famous Poet in the region. Previously
          I had used Closed Source Environments for my program development, however, I developed this App’ in an Open Source
          Environment which exposed me to a new learning habitat that I was engrossed by. Due to my ever growing passion
          for the subject inside and outside of academia, I began to implement the techniques I had been learning for my
          final University project. I built a bespoke Content Management System for websites using PHP, MySQL, Javascript
          and HTML, for which I gained the highest mark in the class.
        </p>

        <p>I continue to develop and learn to this day. I have studied part-time courses in Advanced PHP and JavaScript at Cardiff
          University. I have been learning about the latest and most enhanced methods in programming, like Object Oriented
          Programming and implementing webpages with Ajax Technology, as well as improving in Analyst and Design Algorithms
          I studied whilst previously at University. In my own time I am developing my knowledge of Vue JS and Laravel Frameworks.
          In addition to my self-studies, with support from tutors and professionals I make sure I am up to date with the
          latest technologies and newest methods of programming and software engineering.
        </p>

        <p>
          I spent most of my time coding, reading the latest information about technology, and researching new solutions to unsolved
          programming issues. I am currently building a lot of projects go along side my business which offers web development
          services. I regularly work towards organising services to clients and supporting my business growth. Computers
          do encompass my life, as they are my passion, however I also enjoy reading books (although the book I am currently
          reading is written by Karen Blumenthal, ‘The Man Who thought Different’). I enjoy poetry, art and photography.
          I also like to be up to date with the current political climate and economic development across the world.
